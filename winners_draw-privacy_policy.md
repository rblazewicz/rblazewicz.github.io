**Privacy Policy for Winner's Draw**

**1. Introduction**
This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the Winner's Draw application ("the App") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data.

**2. Device Permissions**
The App requires access to your device’s camera (`android.permission.CAMERA`).
This permission is used **solely** to allow the user to take photographs for the specific purpose of the random selection feature (drawing a winning photo).

**3. Data Collection and Processing**
The App operates locally on your device. Regarding the photos taken by the User:

* **No Data Transmission:** Photos are not transmitted to the developer’s servers or any third-party servers.
* **No Biometric Analysis:** The App does not use facial recognition software or analyze the biometric data of the people in the photos.
* **Local Processing:** The entire process of selecting a "winning" photo occurs locally in the device's temporary memory (RAM) or local storage.

**4. Data Storage**
The App does not create a persistent database in the cloud. Photos taken during the session are stored locally on your device in accordance with standard Android system mechanisms. The User retains full control over these files and can delete them at any time via the device's Gallery or File Manager.

**5. Data Sharing**
The App does not automatically share any data. The User may voluntarily use the system's "Share" functionality to send the selected photo via third-party applications (e.g., messaging apps, social media). This action is initiated and controlled 100% by the User.

**6. Contact Information**
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact app creator.

**7. Changes to this Privacy Policy**
We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes.
